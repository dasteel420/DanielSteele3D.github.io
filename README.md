## Emphasis

Hello, my name is Daniel Steele. I have a bachelors of science in Game Art and Design, I specialise in 3D characters; but over the years I've also grown an equal love for the rigging and animation pipeline as well. One this website you can find art peices i've worked on over the years as well as demonstrations of my auto rigging tools. My primary tool of the trade is Autodesk Maya, but I have a full understanding of the game art pipeline from zbrush, to unwrapping, to texturing. I also have a full understanding of the maya to unreal/unity rigging pipeline.

My program capabilities include, but are not limited to
 -Autodesk Maya
 -3DS Max
 -Adobe Photoshop
 -Substance Painter/designer
 -marvelous designer
 -3Dcoat
